# Collatz parity sequences

Collection of results about Collatz parity sequences.
The parity sequence (or parity vector) of a Collatz sequence is the sequence
of parities (`0` or `1`) of the elements in the Collatz sequence.

TODO:
  - Add the elementary results about parity sequences, summarised in [Rozier2018](https://ccchallenge.org/#Rozier2018), Definition 5.
