Can you finish

example (n k : ℕ) : (2 : ℚ) ^ (n - k) / 2 ^ (n - k - 1) = 2 := by
  have h2 : (2 : ℚ) ≠ 0 := by norm_num
  -- Use the lemma with a := 2, m := n - k, n := n - k - 1
  rw [← zpow_natCast_sub_natCast₀ h2 (n - k) (n - k - 1)]
  -- Compute the subtraction

I'll help you finish this example. Let me first examine the context and then complete the proof. Now I'll complete the proof. The idea is to use the `zpow_natCast_sub_natCast₀` lemma to rewrite the division as a power subtraction, then simplify the arithmetic. 
```

```
Let me fix this by using a simpler approach. The key insight is that after applying the lemma, we need to show that `(n - k) - (n - k - 1) = 1`, which is true arithmetically.

The goal is 2 ^ (↑(n - k) - ↑(n - k - 1)) = 2

We just want to compute the substraction (n-k) - (n-k-1) = 1 then use 2^1 = 1

I'll help you complete the proof by computing the subtraction and simplifying. Let me first check the current state of the file and then finish the proof. Now I'll complete the proof by computing the subtraction `(n-k) - (n-k-1) = 1` and then using `2^1 = 2`: 
```

```
I see the issue. I need to work with the `Int.subNatNat` function that appears after applying the lemma. Let me fix this by explicitly showing that the subtraction equals 1:

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The goal is now `2 ^ Int.subNatNat (n - k) (n - k - 1) = 2`, and we need to show that `Int.subNatNat (n - k) (n - k - 1) = 1`. Let me fix the proof by properly handling the integer subtraction: 
```

```
Let me try a simpler approach by directly computing the arithmetic: 
```

```
Let me try a more direct approach using the fact that the subtraction simplifies to 1: 
```

```
I see the issue. The pattern doesn't match because of casting. Let me try a different approach by showing the equality directly:
