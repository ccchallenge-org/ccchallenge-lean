Can you fix helper8 ?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll examine the `helper8` function to understand what needs to be fixed. Let me first look at the current implementation and identify the issue. Now let me check if there are any errors in this file to understand what's wrong with `helper8`: I can see the issue with `helper8`. The problem is that `zpow_add₀` expects the pattern `2^a * 2^b` but the goal is `2^(1+k+n) = 2*2^(n+k)`. The left side needs to be rewritten first to match the pattern that `zpow_add₀` can work with.

The goal is to prove `2^(1+k+n) = 2*2^(n+k)`. We need to rewrite `2^(1+k+n)` as `2^1 * 2^(k+n)` first, then use the fact that `2^1 = 2`. 
```

```
I see the issue. The `zpow_add₀` is working but in the wrong direction. Let me approach this differently. I need to first use the fact that `1 + k + n = 1 + (k + n)` and then apply `zpow_add₀`. 
```

```
Great! The `helper8` function is now fixed. The errors remaining are from other parts of the code (helper3 and key_ineq), but `helper8` itself is working correctly now. 

Let me verify that `helper8` compiles correctly by checking the errors again:

Can you fix and prove helper 10 and use it as first step in help3 to get rid of /A ?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll fix and prove `helper10` and then use it in `helper3` to simplify the proof by getting rid of the division by `A`.

First, let me look at the current state and fix `helper10`: 
```

```
I see there are several issues with my edit. It looks like there was a formatting problem. Let me read the current file content to see what happened and fix it properly: I can see the file structure. Let me check if there are syntax errors by looking at the full file and fix them step by step. First, let me fix `helper10`: 
```

```
It seems there are issues with the file structure. Let me check what happened and start fresh. Let me first read the exact content around `helper10`: I see there are duplicate definitions causing issues. Let me check the entire file structure around this problem. There seems to be corruption. Let me try to create a fresh version. Let me first identify where the corruption starts: There's definitely corruption in the file. I can see there are multiple malformed definitions. Let me check what happened at line 10: I can see the file is badly corrupted with duplicate and malformed content. Let me revert to a clean state by finding the good content. Let me check what the original good lemmas should be: I can see that the file is corrupted and has malformed content. Let me try to restore a clean state and fix both `helper10` and `helper3`. First, let me check the current state of the file more thoroughly:

  I'm talking about this, as a first step in helper3 we want to get rid of /A on both sides

_**Assistant**_

I understand! You want to prove `helper10` first so that it can be used in `helper3` to eliminate the division by `A` from both sides as the first step. Let me fix both lemmas: 
```

```
I see there are issues with the edit. It seems the file got corrupted. Let me fix this more carefully. The problem is that `div_mul_cancel` needs different arguments. Let me use the correct approach: 
```

```
I see the file structure is corrupted again. Let me read the current state around the helper10

Can you prove lemma helper10 (A B: ℚ): A/B > 0 ↔ A*B > 0 := by

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll prove `helper10` for you. This lemma states that `A/B > 0` if and only if `A*B > 0`, which is a standard result about division and multiplication of rational numbers. 
```

```
The `div_pos_iff` lemma needs a more specific type class. Let me use a more explicit approach: 
```

```
Let me simplify this and use the correct lemmas available in Mathlib: Let me check the exact content first: Let me replace the entire proof with a simpler version: 
```

```
Let me use the correct approach with the right syntax: 
```

```
Perfect! Now `helper10` is proven. The lemma `helper10 (A B: ℚ): A/B > 0 ↔ A*B > 0` is now complete. 

This lemma states that `A/B > 0` if and only if `A*B > 0`, which is a fundamental property: a fraction is positive exactly when the numerator and denominator have the same sign (both positive or both negative), and this is equivalent to their product being positive.

The proof uses `simp only [div_pos_iff, mul_pos_iff]` which applies the built-in Lean lemmas that state:
- `div_pos_iff`: `A/B > 0 ↔ (A > 0 ∧ B > 0) ∨ (A < 0 ∧ B < 0)`
- `mul_pos_iff`: `A*B > 0 ↔ (A > 0 ∧ B > 0) ∨ (A < 0 ∧ B < 0)`

Since both sides have the same logical structure, `simp` automatically proves the equivalence.

can you prove 
n k : ℕ
hn : n > 0
hk : n ≥ k
hp : 2 ^ n > 3 ^ k
⊢ 2 ^ (↑n - ↑k) * (3 ^ ↑k - 2 ^ ↑k) / (2 ^ ↑n - 3 ^ ↑k)

_**Assistant**_

I can see you want to prove that the `max_circuit_element` is non-negative under the given conditions. Let me help you complete this proof. I can see the goal is to prove that `max_circuit_element n k ≥ 0`. Let me complete this proof: 
```
