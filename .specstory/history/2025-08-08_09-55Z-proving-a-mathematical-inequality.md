# Proving a mathematical inequality (2025-08-08 09:55Z)

_**User**_

Would it be easier to prove that 2^(n+k) + 2^k > 3^k + 6^k when 2^n > 3^k (do not use Baker style argument)

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring a Math Inequality**

I need to help with the math question regarding the inequality: proving that \(2^{(n+k)} + 2^k > 3^k + 6^k\) under the assumption \(2^n > 3^k\), without using a Baker style argument. This involves inequalities of exponential terms, maybe linked to Collatz bounds. The user might be working on this in `NewBounds.lean`. I should provide a concise derivation and follow proper communication rules, using markdown for clarity.
**Summarizing the Proving Process**

I need to summarize my thoughts on proving the inequality for integers \(n, k \geq 1\). I'm comparing \(2^{(n+k)} + 2^k\) with \(3^k + 6^k\). Noting that \(6^k\) can be rewritten helps derive: the left-hand side becomes \(2^k(2^n + 1)\), while the right side is \(3^k(1 + 2^k)\). Dividing both sides by \(2^k\) initially seems correct, but I realize that \(2^k < 3^k\) for \(k \geq 1\ complicates the comparison.
**Analyzing the Inequality**

I realize I can't simply replace \(2^k\) with \(3^k\) in the inequality because it leads to inconsistencies. The left side being greater than \(2^k 3^k + 2^k\) doesn’t support the claim that it's greater than \(2^k 3^k + 3^k\). Instead, I should use the assumption \(2^n > 3^k\) and rewrite the inequality accordingly.

I express it as \(2^k(2^n + 1) > 3^k(1 + 2^k)\). By redefining terms, I find that although I introduce \(r = (2/3)^k\), it ends up being less than 1, complicating things further.
**Revising the Approach**

I can alternatively divide the inequality by \(2^k\), leading to \(2^n + 1 > (3/2)^k(1 + 2^k)\). Since \((3/2)^k \times 2^k\) equals \(3^k\), this reformulates the right-hand side to be \((3/2)^k + 3^k\).

Now, to check if \(2^n > 3^k + (3/2)^k - 1\), I realize that this means needing \((3/2)^k \leq 1\), which isn't true. I’m considering that we might need a stronger condition about \(n\) relative to \(k\) to make my case. The goal may require showing that \(2^n - 3^k > (3/2)^k - 1\).
**Exploring Conditions for Inequality**

I’m expanding the inequality, starting with \(2^k(2^n + 1) - 3^k(2^k + 1)\). After reorganizing, I simplify this to \(2^k(2^n - 3^k) + (2^k - 3^k)\). For \(2^n > 3^k\), the first term is positive, while the second is negative since \(2^k < 3^k\) for \(k \geq 1\).

What I need to demonstrate is that \(2^n - 3^k > (3/2)^k - 1\). I realize this means I should be looking for a stronger condition, possibly requiring \(2^n \geq 3^k + \lceil (3/2)^k \rceil\). I'll explore some sufficient conditions that are more straightforward.
**Analyzing Growth Rates**

It seems like the relation \((3/2)^k\) grows slower than \(2^{k-1}\), but when I test values like \(k = 1\), it fails as \(1.5\) is not less than or equal to \(1\). Still, for \(k \geq 1\), \((3/2)^k - 1\) remains less than \(2^{k-1}\). 

I’m considering if a different approach could work, like requiring \(2^n \geq 3^k + 2^k\). This seems to hold because, generally, \(2^k\) is larger than \((3/2)^k\). Finally, ensuring that \(2^n\) exceeds a larger bound shows promise as a sufficient condition!
**Exploring Numeric Bounds**

I'm considering whether there's a simpler numeric threshold since \(3^k \leq 2^n\) doesn't guarantee anything when adding \(2^k\). In many cases, \(n\) is about \(1.585k\), which helps relate \(2^n\) to \(3^k\). However, I find that requiring \(2^n\) to exceed \(3^k + 1\) might be sufficient.

But the challenge lies in establishing a lower bound tight enough to ensure \(2^n\) is consistently greater than \(3^k\). The search for a clean proof prompts me to discuss conditions for \(2^n - 3^k\), and it appears that making such margins clear is more complex than it seems!
**Examining Numerical Relationships**

I’m exploring the relationship between \(2^n\) and \(3^k\) under certain conditions. The goal is to see if \(2^{n+k} + 2^k > 3^k + 6^k\) holds true universally. A key part of this involves defining \(d\) as the difference, which must be greater than or equal to a certain threshold related to \((3/2)^k\).

However, I wonder if \(d\) can occasionally be smaller than this threshold. The approach relies on numerical properties, and I consider if there can be infinitely many cases where the ratio between these powers gets very close. Ultimately, it seems that while bounds often hold, there are still exceptional cases that challenge the established inequality!
**Exploring Exponential Inequalities**

I'm analyzing the inequality \(2^{n+k} + 2^k > 3^k + 6^k\) and its dependence on relationships between \(2^n\) and \(3^k\). This boils down to whether the difference \(d = 2^n - 3^k\) is large enough to ensure the inequality holds. While I suspect it generally works, I realize some examples could yield smaller gaps.

Though we can't avoid deeper arguments, I can provide sufficient conditions and test cases where the inequality reliably holds true across various values of \(k\). Keeping close approximations in mind may allow for edge cases, improving our overall understanding.
**Examining Exponential Inequalities**

I'm investigating the condition that epsilon must be greater than or equal to \(1/2^k\). This sets a requirement for the differences in my number analysis. The distance from \(k\log_2 3\) to the nearest integer could be tiny, particularly as k increases, but I can't guarantee it without using deeper results like Baker's method. 

Essentially, I need to clarify that proving \(2^n > 3^k\) isn't enough. Instead, I should emphasize sufficient conditions, presenting them clearly for practical use, especially if they're looking to formalize this in a lemma. Therefore, it’s essential to be concise and specific about the necessary requirements for the inequality to hold.
**Clarifying the Proof Approach**

I want to include a Lean proof skeleton here, but the user hasn't specifically asked for code. So, I’ll skip that and focus on a concise mathematical explanation.

First, I’ll rewrite the inequality and factor it, noting that a stronger gap is needed: we need \(2^n ≥ 3^k + \lceil(3/2)^k\rceil - 1\). For sufficient conditions, I’ll specify two key points: \(2^n ≥ 3^k + 2^k\) or \(2^n ≥ 2 \cdot 3^k\) (which means \(n ≥ \lceil k \log_2 3 \rceil + 1\)).

Regarding the user’s question about ease, I’ll clarify that without strengthening the assumption, no, it's not easier, but it can become trivial with that assumption. I’ll keep everything as concise as possible!</details></think>

### Short answer
Not from 2^n > 3^k alone. The target inequality
2^(n+k) + 2^k > 3^k + 6^k
is equivalent to
2^n - 3^k > (3/2)^k - 1,
which is strictly stronger than 2^n > 3^k. Proving such a uniform gap without Baker-type estimates is generally not easier.

### Clean reformulations
- Exact equivalence:
  - Let d = 2^n − 3^k (> 0). Then
    2^(n+k) + 2^k > 3^k + 6^k  ⇔  2^k(d + 1) > 3^k  ⇔  d > (3/2)^k − 1.
- Minimal n threshold (for fixed k):
  - The inequality holds iff n ≥ ⌈log2(3^k + (3/2)^k − 1)⌉.

### Easy sufficient conditions (elementary)
Any of the following imply the desired inequality:
- 2^n ≥ 3^k + 2^k  (equivalently 2^{n-k} ≥ 1 + 2^{-k}).
- 2^n ≥ 2·3^k  (i.e., n ≥ ⌈k log2 3⌉ + 1).
- More generally, 2^n/3^k ≥ 1 + 2^{-k}.

These avoid Baker-style arguments but are stronger than 2^n > 3^k.

- If your application can afford n ≥ ⌈k log2 3⌉ + 1, the proof is immediate:
  2^(n+k) + 2^k ≥ 2^k(2·3^k + 1) > 3^k(2^k + 1) = 3^k + 6^k.

Summary:
- The statement is equivalent to requiring the gap 2^n − 3^k exceed (3/2)^k − 1, so 2^n > 3^k alone is insufficient.
- It becomes easy under stronger, elementary assumptions like 2^n ≥ 2·3^k or 2^n ≥ 3^k + 2^k.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing inequalities**

I'm working on an inequality like `2^n - 3^k ≥ 2^k`. Another approach might be to consider the ratio `r = 2^n / 3^k > 1` and see if I can relate it to `r ≥ 1 + (2/3)^k`. Wait, that doesn't seem correct. I need an elementary inequality that shows for `n≥9`, the gaps between powers of 2 are large enough, ensuring that `2^n > 3^k`. Also, I need to find the largest `k` such that `3^k < 2^n`.
**Exploring number theory**

I'm considering using simple case analysis with residues and monotonic arguments. I want to demonstrate that for `n≥9`, the ratio `2^n / 3^k` is at least `1 + (2/3)^k` when `2^n > 3^k`. It feels challenging. Another approach could be to bound the difference from below using a factor of `3^k * ((2/3)^n - 1)`, but that's tricky since `(2/3)^n < 1`. Instead, I can fix `k` and analyze the function `f(n) = 2^n - 3^k - 2^k`, which increases with `n`. I'm wondering if the initial `n0` satisfies `2^n0 ≥ 3^k + 2^k`, confirming the inequality holds for larger `n`.
**Clarifying minimal n**

I need to demonstrate that the minimal `n` for which `2^n > 3^k` also satisfies a stronger inequality. This minimal `n` should meet the criteria `2^{n-1} ≤ 3^k < 2^n`, leading to `2^n ≥ 2·3^k`. This means `2·3^k ≥ 3^k + 2^k`, which simplifies to `3^k ≥ 2^k`, a condition that's true for all `k ≥ 0`. The challenge is that while I can derive this, I also have to account for the upper bounds, which complicates things.
**Establishing inequalities**

If I can establish that `2^n ≥ 2·3^k`, then I’m done! But is `2^n ≥ 2·3^k` guaranteed just from `2^n > 3^k`? Not quite; I need to ensure that `2^n / 3^k ≥ 2`, which is a stronger condition than just being greater than 1. This might not hold for all `n`, but perhaps for `n ≥ 9`. The goal is to prove that for `n ≥ 9`, there can't be any integer `k` such that `3^k` falls between `2^{n-1}` and `2^n`.</details></think>

I'm going to open `CCchallengeLean/NewBounds.lean` to see the current lemmas around the area you're working on and identify where to add a formal proof of the inequality. Then I'll search the codebase for existing helper lemmas about powers like `pow_add`, monotonicity, or integer/rational bounds that we can reuse.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating logarithmic growth**

I'm testing some logic about the growth rates of powers of 2 and 3. For large k relative to n, it seems that 3^k can grow quickly, but 2^n must be greater. For n ≥ 9, I'm wondering if the ratio of 2^n to 3^k could imply a larger gap, potentially requiring k to be less than or equal to a specific logarithmic expression. To prove this for all integers n ≥ 9 and k ≥ 0, I keep breaking down the inequalities and analyzing the conditions for maintaining that gap of at least one in the real numbers.
**Analyzing growth conditions**

I'm thinking about inequalities involving powers of 2 and 3, specifically examining if \(2^{n-k}/(3/2)^k\) can be greater than or equal to \(1 + 1/(3/2)^k\). I realize that \(2^{n-k}\) is an integer while \((3/2)^k\) is a non-integer for \(k \geq 1\). The next integer after \((3/2)^k\) is less than +1 for larger values of \(k\). Given that \(n \geq 9\), I'm considering that \(k\) could be bound by \(n - 3\) and determining if the inequality holds when \(k \leq 5\), which seems to depend on the maximum \(k\) relative to \(n\).
**Proving inequalities**

I need to prove that \(2^{n-k} ≥ (3/2)^k + 1\) for all relevant \(k\). To do this, I’ll define a function \(f(k) = 2^{n-k} - (3/2)^k\) and aim for \(f(k) ≥ 1\) when \(2^n > 3^k\). To ensure the inequality holds, I can set \(k\) as the largest integer where \(2^n > 3^k\), leading to the realization that \(3^k\) must be less than \(2^n - 1\). I’m considering whether the stronger condition of \(3^k ≤ 2^{n-1}\) might be useful and exploring examples, particularly for \(n=9\).
**Testing inequalities for n=9**

For \(n=9\), I've found that the maximum \(k\) where \(2^n > 3^k\) is indeed 5, and it seems \(2^n \geq 2 \cdot 3^k\) holds. I wonder if this is true generally. I need to figure out for which \(n\) the inequality \(2^n / 3^{\text{floor}(n \log_3 2)} ≥ 2\) holds. As \(n\) increases, the ratio approaches 1 asymptotically, so I suspect this might not be universally true. A quick test indicates that \(2^n / 3^k\) lies between 1 and 3, making it uncertain if the \(2 \cdot 3^k\) bound is reliable. However, the user's Python findings suggest that the inequality \(2^n ≥ 3^k + 2^k\) is valid for \(n ≥ 9\).
**Examining inequality bounds**

I’m exploring the scenario where \(3^k\) maximizes under \(2^n\) to test the inequality \(2^n \geq 3^k + 2^k\). If \(2^n - 3^k < 2^k\), the inequality could fail. Using \(k = \text{floor}(n \log_3 2)\), I see that as \(n\) increases, the gap between \(2^n\) and \(3^k\) narrows, and I need to ensure this gap stays above zero. My calculations suggest that for \(n \geq 9\), the inequality holds universally, using comparisons between growth rates and analyzing specific values of \(k\).
**Exploring inequalities**

I’m considering ways to show \(2^n \geq 3^k + 2^k\) directly. Looking at the binary expansion of \(3^k\) might help, as \(2^n - 3^k\) looks like a complement plus one. The goal is to ensure the gap is at least \(2^k\). If we can express \(3^k\) as a sum of binomial powers of two, that could lead us to a clearer conclusion. 

Then, I’m also testing situations where \(3^k\) grows relative to \(2^n\) and trying to establish bounds on \(k\) to guarantee that the inequality holds particularly for \(n \geq 9\). Overall, it feels like there are multiple avenues to derive a more straightforward proof of the relationship.
**Analyzing growth comparisons**

I’m thinking about inequalities that help show \(2^n \geq 3^k + 2^k\). I see that proving \(2^{n+k} \geq 3^k + 6^k\) might not lead to the original inequality since \(6^k\) grows much faster than \(2^k\). 

It's crucial to find an elegant approach to confirm that \(n\) and \(k\) can be linked through logarithmic relationships. I also have to ensure that there's a clear path to show these growths hold collectively for all \(k\). It seems testing against powers directly will be my most straightforward method.
**Exploring inequality proofs**

I’m checking the inequality \(3^k + 2^k \leq 4^k\) for \(k \geq 1\) to find a helpful way to show \(2^n \geq 3^k + 2^k\). If I can show \(2^n \geq 4^k\) when \(n \geq 2k\), that would work. 

But it seems I need conditions around \(n\) and \(k\) more precisely. Direct comparisons and specific bounds won’t yield consistent results, so I might need to focus more on how \(n\) relates to \(k\). Using minimal values and logarithmic comparisons should help refine my approach. I guessed this would be simpler than it is!
**Clarifying inequality conditions**

I see that the inequality \(2^{\lceil \log_2 3\rceil} = 4\) compared to \(3^1 + 2^1 = 5\) fails for \(k=1\). However, the claim is for \(n \geq 9\), not all \(k\). For small \(k\), if \(n\) is large enough, the inequality probably holds. 

I need to show that \(3^{\phi(n)} \geq 1 + (2/3)^{k(n)}\) is valid with \(\phi\) being the fractional part, but I must ensure that \(\phi(n)\) is large enough for all \(n \geq 9\). Since the right-hand side decreases exponentially, I have to consider how small \(\phi(n)\) can get.
**Reassessing gap inequalities**

I need to exclude solutions where \(0 < n \ln 2 - k \ln 3 < c' (2/3)^k \ln 3\). Rearranging gives \(e^{n \ln 2 - k \ln 3} - 1 < (2/3)^k\). I think there might be an elementary proof using binomial expansions, but I need to revisit the ceiling decomposition approach. The gap \(s\) between multiples of \(2^k\) and \(3^k\) has specific bounds. It looks like previous lemmas might have been misremembered, and I need to double-check their correctness as I go.
**Analyzing power-of-two inequalities**

I can bound \(s_k / 2^k \geq (3/4)^k\) which leads me to determine that the next multiple above \(3^k\) has to be at least \(2^{k}\) above. But if \(s_k\) represents the gap, it can't exceed \(2^k\). We really need the next power of two to be at least \(2^k\) greater than \(3^k\). Our core requirement simplifies to checking if \(n-k\) meets certain logarithmic conditions, especially around \(ceil((3/2)^k)\). I'm delving into some potential pitfalls with these powers of two to ensure they align correctly.
I'm looking into the various values of \(k\) to see how they affect the ceiling function of \((3/2)^k\). It appears only smaller odd \(k\) yield a power of two in this context. For larger \(k\), it seems less likely that \((3/2)^k\) will align perfectly with powers of two.

To maintain the inequality with \(n\) values greater than or equal to 9, I'll need a solid proof that adequately addresses tight cases and provides a way to show that \(2^{n} - 3^k\) exceeds \(2^k\). We can establish bounds for different ranges of \(k\) to verify the inequality holds universally.
I'm analyzing the relationship between powers of two and powers of three with respect to specific values of \(k\). My goal is to show that the difference \(2^n - 3^k\) maintains a certain threshold depending on the value of \(k\). 

For \(k \leq 4\), it's manageable since I can establish inequalities easily. However, for \(k \geq 5\), I need a more rigorous approach. I can argue that if \(n\) is sufficiently large, specifically \(n \geq \lceil k \log_2 3 \rceil + 1\), the inequality will hold true. 

To ensure clarity, I need to validate any potential cases where the condition might fail, particularly when \(n = \lceil k \log_2 3 \rceil\) for \(k\) values that increase. In that scenario, I want to check whether \(\lceil (3/2)^k \rceil\) can be a power of two. If I can establish that it isn't, it strengthens my overall argument.
I'm working through the relationship between \(n\) and \(k\), specifically focusing on how to prove an inequality when \(n ≥ 9\). Since \(k\) is approximately less than \(\alpha n\), I can derive bounds for \(2^{n-k}\) and show that it grows exponentially.

I discover that for each increment of \(n\), the difference between \(n\) and \(k\) increases moderately. As I calculate small values, like for \(n = 9\), \(10\), and beyond, I confirm the inequality holds. The left-hand side, related to the powers of two, consistently outgrows the right, so the entire argument seems solid, especially for larger \(n\).
I'm analyzing how to establish inequality relationships for \(n\) values, especially when \(n\) is greater than or equal to 9. The left side of the equation grows exponentially while the right side grows linearly. Through various checks, I find that for \(n = 12\), \(2^{n/3}\) holds up against \(n + 3\).

I walk through steps, demonstrating that using expansions and bounding techniques helps establish crucial inequalities. I see that these comparisons yield valid results up to any size \(n\), ensuring the inequality is maintained, and the argument stays accessible and reasonable.
I'm working through the idea that between two increments of \(t(n)\), there must have been at least one step with no increment due to \(\alpha < 1\). This ensures that the left-hand side (LHS) has doubled at least once. I find it essential to maintain a positive lower bound on a value \(S(n)\) throughout the process. 

By establishing rigorous steps and bounding techniques, especially in how \(S(n)\) behaves during increment and no increment patterns, I show that this keeps the inequality intact for all \(n \geq 9\). I emphasize avoiding complex proofs and instead aim for a clean, elementary argument.</details></think>

### Goal
Prove: For all integers n ≥ 9, if 2^n > 3^k then 2^n ≥ 3^k + 2^k. No Baker-style arguments.

### Key reductions
- Write 3^k via binomial expansion: 3^k = (2 + 1)^k = Σ_{j=0}^k C(k,j) 2^j.
- Then 3^k + 2^k = Σ_{j=0}^{k-1} C(k,j) 2^j + 2·2^k ≤ (k + 2)·2^k, since each C(k,j) ≤ 2^k and there are k terms plus the top 2·2^k.
- So it suffices to show: 2^{n−k} ≥ k + 2.

Thus, the problem reduces to proving a one-variable inequality relating n and k under the constraint 2^n > 3^k.

### Bounding k in terms of n
- Let α = log_3 2 ∈ (0,1). From 2^n > 3^k we get k ≤ ⌊α n⌋.
- Define t(n) := ⌊α n⌋ and s(n) := n − t(n). Then k ≤ t(n), hence
  2^{n−k} ≥ 2^{n−t(n)} = 2^{s(n)} and k + 2 ≤ t(n) + 2.
- Therefore it is enough to prove, for all n ≥ 9:
  2^{s(n)} ≥ t(n) + 2.

### A clean discrete inequality on s(n) and t(n)
Set S(n) := 2^{s(n)} − (t(n) + 2). We will show S(n) > 0 for all n ≥ 9.

- Base case (n = 9): α n ≈ 5.678 ⇒ t(9) = 5 and s(9) = 4. Then
  2^{s(9)} = 16 and t(9) + 2 = 7, so S(9) = 9 > 0.

- Step n → n+1:
  - Either t(n+1) = t(n) (no “jump”), then s(n+1) = s(n) + 1 and
    S(n+1) = 2·2^{s(n)} − (t(n) + 2) − 1 = 2 S(n) − 1.
  - Or t(n+1) = t(n) + 1 (a “jump”), then s(n+1) = s(n) and
    S(n+1) = S(n) − 1.

These are the only two transitions. Starting from S(9) = 9, the worst sequence (minimizing S) alternates “jump” then “no jump”, i.e., S → (S − 1) then → 2(S − 1) − 1 = 2S − 3. For S ≥ 3 we have 2S − 3 ≥ S, so after any such pair S does not decrease. Since S(9) ≥ 9 ≥ 3, S(n) remains ≥ 3 forever, hence S(n) > 0 for all n ≥ 9.

Therefore, for all n ≥ 9: 2^{s(n)} ≥ t(n) + 2. Consequently, for any k with 2^n > 3^k,
- 2^{n−k} ≥ 2^{s(n)} ≥ t(n) + 2 ≥ k + 2,
- hence 2^n ≥ (k + 2)·2^k ≥ 3^k + 2^k.

### Conclusion
For every n ≥ 9 and every k with 2^n > 3^k, we have 2^n ≥ 3^k + 2^k. The proof is elementary:
- use 3^k ≤ (k + 1)·2^k (from binomial expansion),
- reduce to showing 2^{n−k} ≥ k + 2,
- and verify the one-variable inequality 2^{n − ⌊α n⌋} ≥ ⌊α n⌋ + 2 holds for all n ≥ 9 via the monotone recursion on S(n).

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Testing mathematical claims**

I'm running a quick test on some values: for n=9 and n=10, the calculations hold up. However, for n=11, I’m double-checking if the floor function is applied correctly. I realize my understanding around α might be off, as I initially used log_3 2, but could it be log_2 3 instead? I’ll need to assess my inequality further and see if it holds for small n values. There’s a lot to untangle here!
**Analyzing the inequality**

I'm testing the inequality with various values. For n=1, everything holds, but at n=2, there’s a failure. However, since the domain starts at n=9, it seems to hold for larger numbers. Now I'm considering if the user might be looking at t(n) as floor(n / log2 3), which simplifies in terms but doesn’t change the value. As I calculate further values for n, I note that the bounds in my earlier proof might have been too rough, so I need to reassess that.
**Verifying combinatorial bounds**

I'm trying to verify the equality involving 3^k and combinations. I realize I need to assess my bounds for each term. Initially, I thought C(k,j) would always be less than or equal to 2^k, but that’s not fully accurate, especially when j is close to k/2. In those cases, the growth of C(k, k/2) exceeds my expectations, which leads to inconsistencies in my bounds. So, I’ll need to refine my approach here and rethink how I’m handling the inequalities.
**Reevaluating the inequality proof**

I've realized that my bound stating 3^k ≤ (k+1) 2^k is completely false. The user’s comment about "2^{s(n)} ≥ t(n)+2 is never true" might be pointing out this error in my reasoning. I suspect that my reduction was too simplistic, which is a good catch! We need to find a stronger proof for n ≥ 9. I’m considering that we can express the relationship as 2^{n-k} ≥ (3/2)^k + 1 to refine our approach.
**Exploring the gap for inequality**

I need to establish a gap of at least 1 here, which means verifying integer properties for both sides of my inequality. To ensure 2^{n-k} is an integer, I might check if ceil((3/2)^k) is less than or equal to 2^{n-k} - 1. However, finding the right conditions is tricky. I realize that the relationship for k could lead to challenges in ensuring strict inequalities. I need to analyze whether 2^{n-k} could equal ceil((3/2)^k) and how that influences the overall proof structure.
**Analyzing inequalities and gaps**

I want to explore the relationship between 3^k and powers of two more generally. My aim is to establish whether 2^n is greater than or equal to 3^k + 2^k by evaluating the gaps. I'll need to show that for n ≥ 9, the difference achieves necessary bounds. There’s a delicate interplay here regarding k's relationship to n, especially as their values grow. Careful consideration of these valuations will help solidify the proof. I must ensure that my derived inequalities reliably reflect this relationship.
**Exploring inequalities and powers**

I’ve established that k < n, so k is less than or equal to n - 1, and I need to compare 2^n - 3^k with 2^{n-1}. If I can show that 3^k is less than or equal to 2^{n-1}, then I can conclude my comparison. However, it seems complicated because when n is minimal such that 2^n exceeds 3^k, 3^k might be greater than 2^{n-1}. This is leading me to explore binomial expansion and find alternate approaches to solidify my condition.
**Analyzing powers and inequalities**

I’m exploring the relationship between ceil((3/2)^k) and powers of 2. If ceil((3/2)^k) equals 2^m, then I see that log2((3/2)^k) has to be less than or equal to m. This means n - k needs to be increasingly larger than log2((3/2)^k). I must consider if equality is possible, which can lead to failures of the inequality. I'm estimating bounds for k based on certain values of n, specifically focusing on cases where n is at least 9, while keeping my inequalities in check. It's very intricate!
**Refining inequality bounds**

I’m examining bounds for k relative to n, focusing on cases where n is at least 9. If I consider k = n - 2 or k = n - 3, inequalities arise—specifically, I’m trying to ensure 3^(n-3) < 2^n holds true. I’ve determined that for n ≥ 9, this means k must be at least n - 4. I want to establish clearer inequalities, as I suspect it’s necessary for 2^n to be greater than the combined terms involving 3^k. My logic seems complex, but I’m narrowing in on a clean conclusion!
**Analyzing inequality conditions**

I’m working through this inequality involving powers of 2 and 3. I noticed that when I manipulate the terms, the inequality simplifies in ways that initially seem valid, but I have to be cautious about potential inconsistencies with how I approach the bounds. My goal is to show that with n at least 9, 2^n will always be larger than 3^k plus some extra term. I sense I need to explore more about these gaps and try bounds to affirm the relationship consistently. It’s a tricky balance, but I’m keen to find the right proof!
**Exploring inequality bounds**

I’m analyzing the inequality involving powers of 2 and 3. It seems for small values of k, there's a constant margin that pushes n to increase, so I’ll analyze cases based on k relative to n. I’m trying to fix bounds to show that for n ≥ 9, conditions hold. I need to prove the relationship without assumptions leading me astray. There are interesting insights about using binary representations and the maximum k, but I need clearer definitions on gaps and behavior as k increases. It's a complex maze of reasoning!
**Analyzing exponential inequalities**

I’m investigating exponential inequalities involving powers of 2 and 3. For k=6 and n=10, I find the difference satisfies the condition. As I check higher values, I need to prove general cases, focusing on the relationship between 2^n and 3^k. Notably, I explore how gaps grow and use inequalities, seeking ratio bounds. I suspect there might be counterexamples for small odd k that could disprove the universal claim under certain conditions, especially when considering the behavior of k as it increases. It's a tricky balance!
**Exploring exponential bounds**

I’m analyzing the relationship between powers of 1.5 and 2, observing how they relate to integers. It seems 1.5^k can land between certain powers of two, but for ceil to equal a power, 1.5^k must lie very close to that power. This occurrence might be rare as k increases. I’m also working out a proof confirming that if n is large enough, specifically n ≥ 9, there are bounds on k that keep inequalities intact. It's a complex balance of growth rates!
**Acknowledging complexity in bounds**

I realized my previous approach regarding bounding 3^k and its implications was flawed. Since g(k) is increasing, we really only need to focus on the largest k, but I initially mismanaged how k relates to n. It turns out the inequalities can lead to incorrect conclusions, especially if I try bounding 3^k by other terms. I need to clarify that while k ≤ n−4 is true, proving the main inequality remains tricky. It might require a simpler method, perhaps using modular arithmetic. My earlier conclusions about approximations were misleading and unverified. I'll need to admit the mistakes and pivot to more reliable proofs!
**Clarifying inequalities and bounds**

I found some inconsistencies in my previous reasoning about the bounds. Notably, the claim that ceil(x) ≥ x + (3/4)^k can't hold for large k since (3/4)^k shrinks below 1. This suggests the gap between ceil(x) and x might be small, but their assertion leads to stronger comparisons than what we've established. I need to acknowledge my earlier mistakes and clarify that the inequality I suggested is not valid without deeper Diophantine approximations. Hence, I should propose alternative arguments or proofs, focusing on k values, to provide a clearer path forward.
**Exploring inequalities and margins**

I’m examining how the inequality holds for different values of k, particularly starting with k=6. For k=6, I found that the minimum m satisfying 2^m > (3/2)^k is 4, which gives a margin greater than 1. This pattern continues as I test higher k values; for k=7 and k=8, the margins also remain adequate. However, I need to confirm that, for larger k, 1.5^k can't be close to a power of two by using modular arithmetic. This exploration might help prove the inequalities effectively without complex tools.
**Revising inequalities**

I’m considering using modulo 16 to analyze the expressions. For k ≥ 2, I found that 3^k ≡ 1 mod 8 leads to a difference of at least 7, but that doesn't meet the requirements for 2^k. I realize my reduction to 2^{s(n)} ≥ t(n) + 2 was incorrect. I need to acknowledge this mistake and clarify the right equivalence, which indicates more complex methods may be needed for a complete proof. I'll suggest a way forward and present a more elementary sufficient condition.</details></think>

You're right — my reduction to “2^{s(n)} ≥ t(n) + 2” was wrong.

- The bad step was bounding 3^k by something like (k+1)·2^k via a termwise estimate from (2+1)^k; that bound is false (e.g., the middle binomial coefficients are ≫ 2^{k−j}).

- The correct normalization is:
  2^n ≥ 3^k + 2^k ⇔ 2^{n−k} ≥ (3/2)^k + 1.
  From 2^n > 3^k we only get 2^{n−k} > (3/2)^k, and to upgrade “>” to “≥ … + 1” one must rule out that 2^{n−k} equals the immediate integer ceiling of (3/2)^k. Equivalently: for all such k, (3/2)^k is never within 1 of a power of two. That is a Diophantine-approximation statement (about |(n−k) − k·log₂(3/2)|) typically proved with linear forms in logarithms (Baker); avoiding that machinery makes a uniform proof delicate.

- Empirically your script shows no counterexamples up to n < 200, but that doesn’t constitute a proof. A safe elementary sufficient condition is:
  if 2^n ≥ 2·3^k (i.e., n ≥ ⌈k·log₂3⌉+1), then 2^{n−k} ≥ 2·(3/2)^k > (3/2)^k + 1, hence 2^n ≥ 3^k + 2^k.
  This is stronger than the premise 2^n > 3^k but needs no Baker-style input.

If you want, I can either:
- formalize the above sufficient condition in Lean, or
- set up a finite-but-large verified range (e.g., all n ≤ N) inside Lean for your use case.
